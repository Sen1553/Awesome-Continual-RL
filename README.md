# awesome-Continual-RL
This repository collects important papers in the field of **Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL)** and **Lifelong Reinforcement Learning (LRL)**, aiming to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date resource for researchers. Continual and lifelong RL are valuable research directions that help agents learn adaptively and robustly in **non-stationary environments**. Contributions and suggestions for missing important works are always welcome.
