## üìù Survey

- Zuffer A, Burke M, Harandi M. **Advancements and Challenges in Continual Reinforcement Learning: A Comprehensive Review**[J]. arXiv preprint arXiv:2506.21899, 2025.[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21899)

    `TL;DR: This paper serves as a comprehensive and systematic survey about CL and CRL. While it offers a solid and accessible entry point for newcomers to the field, the classification of CRL approaches is relatively limited and does not cover some of the most recent advancements.`  


- Pan C, Yang X, Li Y, et al. **A Survey of Continual Reinforcement Learning**[J]. arXiv preprint arXiv:2506.21872, 2025.[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21872)

    `TL;DR: This paper provides an up-to-date and comprehensive survey of CRL. It introduces a new taxonomy that categorizes methods into four types: policy-focused, experience-focused, dynamics-focused, and reward-focused, from the perspective of knowledge storage and transfer.`

### ICML 2025

- Mesbahi G, Panahi P M, Mastikhina O, et al. **Position: Lifetime tuning is incompatible with continual reinforcement learning**[C]//Forty-second International Conference on Machine Learning Position Paper Track.[[Paper]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=JMoWFkwnvv)


### ICLR 2025
- Ahn H, Hyeon J, Oh Y, et al. **Prevalence of negative transfer in continual reinforcement learning: Analyses and a simple baseline**[C]//The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations. 2025.[[Paper]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=KAIqwkB3dT)[[Code]](https://github.com/hongjoon0805/Reset-Distill)

    `TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that negative transfer is prevalent in CRL. Reset & Distill (R&D) tackles this with a dual-learner approach: an online network resets its parameters for each new task to eliminate negative transfer and efficiently learn, while an offline network sequentially distills knowledge from the online actor and previous expert policies to prevent catastrophic forgetting.`  

### ICRA 2025
- Roy K, Dissanayakc A, Tidd B, et al. **M2distill: Multi-modal distillation for lifelong imitation learning**[C]//2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA). IEEE, 2025: 1429-1435.[[Paper]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11128857/)
  
    `TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-modal distillation-based lifelong imitation learning approach, which imposes constraints on the alterations in latent representations and action distributions. Experimental results on the LIBERO benchmark show superior performance in retaining old skills while learning new tasks. `
### NeurIPS 2022
- Wolczyk M, ZajƒÖc M, Pascanu R, et al. **Disentangling transfer in continual reinforcement learning**[J]. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2022, 35: 6304-6317.[[Paper]](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/2938ad0434a6506b125d8adaff084a4a-Abstract-Conference.html)
    
    `TL;DR: This paper empirically investigates how SAC components impact transfer in CRL, highlighting the critic's paramount role and providing key design recommendations. Based on experimental observations, it proposes ClonEx-SAC, leveraging behavioral cloning and exploration strategy to significantly boost performance and forward transfer on Continual World.`  


## üåé Benchmarks

### NeurIPS 2021
- Wo≈Çczyk M, ZajƒÖc M, Pascanu R, et al. **Continual world: A robotic benchmark for continual reinforcement learning**[J]. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2021, 34: 28496-28510.[[Paper]](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/ef8446f35513a8d6aa2308357a268a7e-Abstract.html)[[Code]](https://github.com/awarelab/continual_world)

    `TL;DR: This paper proposes Continual World, a new benchmark for CRL built on Meta-World. It empirically evaluates seven CL methods on Continual World and finds that existing CL methods effectively mitigate forgetting but largely fail to achieve positive forward transfer, reflecting an inefficient utilization of previously learned knowledge.`

### CoRL 2019

     `TL;DR: This paper proposes Meta-World, a benchmark for meta-reinforcement learning and multi-task learning consisting of 50 distinct robotic manipulation tasks. It evaluates seven meta-RL and multi-task learning algorithms, including MTSAC, to assess generalization across diverse tasks. Meta-World has since become a widely used benchmark in continual reinforcement learning (CRL) research.`
