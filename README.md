    `TL;DR: This paper provides an up-to-date and comprehensive survey of CRL. It introduces a new taxonomy that categorizes methods into four types: policy-focused, experience-focused, dynamics-focused, and reward-focused, from the perspective of knowledge storage and transfer.`

    `TL;DR: This paper argues that key assumptions of standard RL, such as MDP formulations, optimal policy focus, and episodic evaluation, are misaligned with the goals of CRL.

    `TL;DR: This paper presents LEGION, a robotic lifelong reinforcement learning framework that continually preserves and recombines knowledge across tasks. Leveraging a Bayesian non-parametric knowledge space and language embeddings, it integrates an upstream task inference module with a downstream single policy conditioned on latent task representations, enabling efficient transfer and long-horizon task execution.`

    `TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that negative transfer is prevalent in CRL. Reset & Distill (R&D) tackles this with a dual-learner approach: an online network resets its parameters for each new task to eliminate negative transfer and efficiently learn, while an offline network sequentially distills knowledge from the online actor and previous expert policies to prevent catastrophic forgetting.`  

### ICRA 2025
- Roy K, Dissanayakc A, Tidd B, et al. **M2distill: Multi-modal distillation for lifelong imitation learning**[C]//2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA). IEEE, 2025: 1429-1435.[[Paper]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11128857/)
  
    `TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-modal distillation-based lifelong imitation learning approach, which imposes constraints on the alterations in latent representations and action distributions. Experimental results on the LIBERO benchmark show superior performance in retaining old skills while learning new tasks.`

### NeurIPS 2024
- Chung W, Cherif L, Meger D, et al. **Parseval regularization for continual reinforcement learning**[J]. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2024, 37: 127937-127967.[[Paper]](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/file/e6df4efa20adf8ef9acb80e94072a429-Paper-Conference.pdf)[[Code]](https://github.com/wechu/parseval_reg)

    `TL;DR: This paper introduces Parseval regularization to mitigate plasticity loss in CRL. It adds a term to the objective function to maintain the orthogonality of weight matrices, applied to both the policy and value networks across all layers except the last, thereby preserving optimization properties and improving the agent‚Äôs ability to learn new tasks. `

### ICML 2023
- Sokar G, Agarwal R, Castro P S, et al. **The dormant neuron phenomenon in deep reinforcement learning**[C]//International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2023: 32145-32168.[[Paper]](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sokar23a/sokar23a.pdf)[[Code]](https://github.com/timoklein/redo)

    `TL;DR: This paper attributes the reduced expressivity of reinforcement learning networks to the dormant neuron phenomenon, showing through extensive experiments that the proportion of inactive neurons increases during training. It introduces ReDo, a simple yet effective method that periodically reinitializes inactive neurons based on their activation statistics to restore network expressivity.`


### Conference on Lifelong Learning Agents (CoLLAs) 2023
- Abbas Z, Zhao R, Modayil J, et al. **Loss of plasticity in continual deep reinforcement learning**[C]//Conference on lifelong learning agents. PMLR, 2023: 620-636.[[Paper]](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v232/abbas23a/abbas23a.pdf)[[Code]](https://github.com/timoklein/crelu-pytorch)

    `TL;DR: This paper investigates plasticity loss in CRL by tracking the evolution of weights, gradients, and activations. The authors observe activation collapse, where only a few neurons remain active in non-stationary environments, leading to vanishing gradients and stagnant network weights. Replacing ReLU with CReLU activations mitigates loss of plasticity and sustains learning over time.`

Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2022, 35: 6304-6317.[[Paper]](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/2938ad0434a6506b125d8adaff084a4a-Abstract-Conference.html)
    
    `TL;DR: This paper empirically investigates how SAC components impact transfer in CRL, highlighting the critic's paramount role and providing key design recommendations. Based on experimental observations, it proposes ClonEx-SAC, leveraging behavioral cloning and exploration strategy to significantly boost performance and forward transfer on Continual World.`  

### ICLR 2022

    `TL;DR: This paper investigates capacity loss in RL, where networks gradually lose the ability to fit new targets. Using feature rank to quantify representational capacity, the authors propose Initial Feature Regularization (InFeR), which constrains a subspace of features to stay close to initial values, preserving feature rank and mitigating capacity loss across diverse RL settings.`  

### ICML 2018
- Schwarz J, Czarnecki W, Luketina J, et al. **Progress & compress: A scalable framework for continual learning**[C]//International conference on machine learning. PMLR, 2018: 4528-4537.[[Paper]](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/schwarz18a.html?ref=https://githubhelp.com)

    `TL;DR: This paper introduces Progress & Compress (P&C), a scalable continual learning framework with online EWC for robust knowledge retention. An active column learns new tasks in the progress phase, while a knowledge base consolidates them via distillation in the compress phase. Experiments on handwritten alphabet classification, Atari, and 3D maze navigation validate the effectiveness of P&C.`

## üåé Benchmarks

### NeurIPS 2021
- Wo≈Çczyk M, ZajƒÖc M, Pascanu R, et al. **Continual world: A robotic benchmark for continual reinforcement learning**[J].

     `TL;DR: This paper proposes Meta-World, a benchmark for meta-reinforcement learning and multi-task learning consisting of 50 distinct robotic manipulation tasks. It evaluates seven meta-RL and multi-task learning algorithms, including MTSAC, to assess generalization across diverse tasks. Meta-World has become a widely used benchmark in CRL research.`
